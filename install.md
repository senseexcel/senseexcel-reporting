##  1. PREPARE SERVER

 1.  Confirm Qlik Sense Server version. November 2017 or later is required.

 2.  Please install the NET Core Runtime prior to this installation. Click to [Download](https:/www.microsoft.com/net/download/Windows/run)
 
 3. Create the following sub-directories within your Qlik Share directories.
 
\Reporting

\Reporting\SERReports

## 2. PREPARE INSTALLATION FILES

 1. Unzip Sense Excel Reporting.zip to the \Reporting directory
 
 ![Install Files](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel-reporting/blob/master/docs/Files-Install.PNG)
 

## 3. INSTALL CONNECTOR

1. Execute InstallConnector.bat from the \Reporting directory.  

 ![Install Connector](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel-reporting/blob/master/docs/Connector-Console.PNG)

2. Security keys will be created in the %appdata%\Roaming\senseexcel\reporting directory.

3. Restart Qlik Repository Services and all sub-processes.
 

## 4. INSTALL EXTENSION

Install the ser-ext-ondemand extension on the Qlik Sense server.

QMC> MANAGE RESOURCES > EXTENSIONS +  Import + Choose File

\Reporting\Extension\ser-ext-ondemand.zip

![Install Extension](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel-reporting/blob/master/docs/Extension-Install.PNG)


##  5. EDIT CONNECTOR CONFIGURATION FILE

In a typical installation, this file will not need to be changed. 

In limited cases there may need to be changes to parameters such as directory paths or server identification parameters. For additional information consult the example file \Reporting\Connector\config.hjson.example.

If changes to this configuration are necessary, perform the following steps.

1. Open the following file using Notepad or other text editor:

\Reporting\Connector\config.hjson.

2. To update directory paths.

By default all directory paths are relative.  If fixed directory paths are required they can be updated in the following parameters.

workingDir: %temp%\senseexcelreportingser

EnginePath: \Reporting\Engine\SenseExcelReporting.exe

cert: %appdata%\senseexcel\reporting\serconnector.pem

privateKey: %appdata%\senseexcel\reporting\serconnector_private.key

## Note

from current release version **3.2.0** please change in your config.hjson 

"serEnginePath" : ..\netcoreapp2.1\Engine\ **SenseExcelReporting.exe** 

**to**    

"serEnginePath": ..\netcoreapp2.1\Engine\ **ser-engine.dll**

3. To update Server identification parameters.

bindingHost: localhost

serverUri: https://localhost/ser

4. Save and close config.hjson file.

5. Restart SER Connector.

6. Restart Qlik Sense Repository Service and all sub-processes.


## 6. ADD LICENSE INFORMATION

There are two steps to this process.

1. Create a license.txt file. Choose an approach from below based on your organization's Qlik Sense licensing strategy.

2. Create a content library on the QMC and upload the license.txt file

### Token Licensing 

 1. Open a new text file.  
 
 2. Copy and paste your LEF information.
 
 3. Delete any spaces at end of each line.
 
 4. Save file with name license.txt.

### Named Licensing

 1. Open a new text file.  
 
 2. Copy and paste your LEF information.
 
 3. Append the LEF information with the DOMAIN\user information for each user. See the example below.
 
  ![License Example](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel-reporting/blob/master/docs/License-Example.PNG).
  
 4. The FROM:TO info is optional. This will put a start and end date on your specified users. Use the format YYYY-MM-DD.
 
 5. Delete any spaces at end of each line.
 
 6. Save file with name license.txt.
 
### Add License Content Library and Upload License Information

A Content Library needs to be added to the Qlik Sense server for license management services.

1. QMC > Content Libraries >  +Create New > senseexcel

![Content Library](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel-reporting/blob/master/docs/Content-Library-Add.PNG)

2. Check the Advanced Property on the right side of the screen.
 
In the Conditions Box add the value below
 
!user.IsAnonymous

![Content Library Advanced](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel-reporting/blob/master/docs/Content-Library-Advanced.PNG)

3. Hit the Apply Button

4. Check the Contents Property under Associated Items

5. Upload the license.txt file.
 
 
## 7. ADD ANALYTIC CONNECTION
 
This process creates a new Analytic Connection in the QMC to allow the Sense Excel Reporting processes to bind with the Qlik Sense Engine.

Define the name, Host, Port, Reconnect Timeout and Reg Timeout parameters.  The name value IS CASE SENSITIVE and must be exactly SER.

QMC > MANAGE CONTENT > Analytic Connections > + Create New

|Setting|Value         |
|-------|--------------|
|Name   | SER          |
|Host   | localhost    |
|Port   | 50059        |
|Reconnect Timeout | 30|
|Request Timeout   | 30|

 ![Analytic Connection](https://github.com/senseexcel/senseexcel-reporting/blob/master/docs/Analytic-Connection.PNG)


## 8. ADD VIRTUAL PROXY

In this section you will define a new Virtual Proxy and then link it to the Main Proxy.  This process is done to allow user and session information to be securely communicated between the Sense Excel Reporting Engine and the Qlik Sense Server.

This operation MUST be done in a particular order. 

### Add

Create the Virtual Proxy via the QMCâ€™s Virtual Proxy menu first. To ensure that the links will work properly DO NOT utilize the Create New Virtual Proxy technique within the QMC Proxy Menu. 

QMC > CONFIGURE SYSTEM > Virtual proxies > + Create new

Check the following Properties on the right side of your screen.

Identification

Authentication

Load Balancing

Advanced

#### IDENTIFICATION

|Setting|Value|
|--|--|
|Description  |ser |
|Prefix|ser |
|Session inactivity timeout | 30 |
|Session cookie header name | X-Qlik-Session-ser|

Open the file %appdata%/senseexcel/reporting/serconnector.pem in a text editor.

Copy the full contents and paste them into the JWT certificate area shown below.

#### AUTHENTICATION

|Setting|Value|
|--|--|
|Anonymous access mode | No anonymous user   |
|Authentication method | JWT|
JWT certificate | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- |
|JWT attribute for user ID | UserId|
|JWT attribute value for user directory | UserDirectory|

#### LOAD BALANCING

Load Balancing nodes > Server node > +Add New Server node > Central

#### ADVANCED
Host white list > Add New Value > YOUR SERVER NAME


### LINK PROXIES
This step is performed last to ensure that the link between the Central Proxy and the newly created ser Virtual proxy will work properly.

QMC > Proxies > Virual Proxies, Central (Default)  > Associate Items > Virtual Proxies > SER > +Add > Link Existing > ser

## 9. ADD SECURITY RULES

These security rules are defined to allow the Sense Excel processes to interact properly with the Qlik Sense engine.  All parameters are CASE SENSITIVE.

### Shared Content
